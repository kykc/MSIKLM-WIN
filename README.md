Port of MSIKLM to Windows for those who doesn't like to use Dragon Center and want to control keyboard LEDs

Don't forget to add ``--recursive`` flag during checkout, as this repo uses [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

As this is just a wrapper repo with solution/project files you can find info about the utility itself in the [main repo](https://github.com/kykc/MSIKLM)
